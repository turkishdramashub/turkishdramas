  "story": "Ertan Aydın, one of Istanbul’s most feared and respected lawyers, has built his entire life on power, influence, and control. For years, Ertan believed he could bend justice to his will—until the sudden death of his father shatters the perfect world he built. As he prepares to take over the Aydın family empire, a hidden truth from the past resurfaces, threatening to expose a scandal that could destroy everything his family created.\n\nAt the same time, Asya, a brilliant but troubled young woman raised in the harsh realities of Istanbul’s backstreets, makes a living through small-scale cons. She is sharp, fearless, and carries wounds from a childhood full of betrayal. When her life unexpectedly collides with Ertan’s, she becomes entangled in a dangerous game much bigger than anything she has known.\n\nErtan initially sees Asya as just another pawn—someone he can use to solve a problem that money and influence cannot fix. But Asya soon proves she is far more intelligent, unpredictable, and emotionally complex than Ertan imagined. What starts as a partnership built on lies slowly turns into a connection neither of them can control.\n\nAs dark family secrets, political corruption, and old enemies rise to the surface, Ertan and Asya are forced to confront their deepest fears. Every truth uncovered pulls them deeper into a world where loyalty is a luxury and betrayal is the only currency. In this dangerous battle of justice and deception, both must decide: will they expose the lies—or become the biggest liars of all?"
