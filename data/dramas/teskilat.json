  "story": "In the heart of Istanbul a covert team of elite agents operates in the shadows, under the highest authority of the nation’s intelligence apparatus. Serdar, a former special-operations officer turned field leader, is tasked with assembling one of the most dangerous missions of his life. His team includes Zehra, a brilliant cyber-intelligence analyst carrying her own emotional scars; Hakkı Dayı, the old-school veteran with a razor-sharp mind and loyalty that runs deeper than blood; Hulki, the unpredictable but fiercely dedicated operative whose past remains a mystery; and Uzay, the master infiltrator who always plays the long game.\n\nTheir objective: dismantle a vast criminal network that reaches from the neon-lit streets of Istanbul to the highest corridors of global power. The conspirators manipulate governments, traffic weapons, and move money through invisible pipelines. With each mission the line between law and morality blurs, forcing the team to confront their own beliefs, their deepest fears, and the cost of serving the country they love.\n\nWhen the network’s reach touches Serdar’s personal life—bringing betrayal, loss and a difficult choice between duty and vengeance—the team must pull together like never before. Terrible secrets from Zehra’s past surface, Hulki’s allegiances are tested, and Hakkı Dayı faces a decision that could destroy everything he built.\n\nIn a world where trust is a weapon and deception is currency, the only certainty is that no mission is ever over. The team’s greatest enemy might just be the one they stop trusting."
